INSTALLATION AND DEPENDENCIES

  Ease of installation is one of Devel::Ladybug’s goals. The only
  requirements are "gcc" (or equivalent) and a modern/working Perl 5
  (5.8.8+). All other dependencies (listed in Makefile.PL) are handled by
  CPAN, and generally install with no fuss.

  The recommended way to install Devel::Ladybug is via CPAN:

    perl −MCPAN −e 'install Devel::Ladybug'

  Answer "yes" when prompted to install dependencies.

  Devel::Ladybug does not depend on any particular DBI driver‐‐ the
  package of your choice needs to be installed separately in order to be
  usable by Devel::Ladybug as a backing store type. These include:
  DBD::mysql, DBD::Pg, and DBD::SQLite.

INSTALL PROBLEMS?

  The most common installation problem is due to a compiler (gcc) not
  being present on the local machine. After installing gcc, you may need
  to purge the contents of the CPAN build directory (probably
  ~root/.cpan/build), and re‐run the install command.

  Refer to recent CPAN Testers results to see if Devel::Ladybug "should"
  work with your particular software stack. Installation problems may be
  reported to the author via email (please include the output from "make
  test")

MANUAL INSTALL

  Assuming dependencies have been installed, installation may also
  be done manually:

    perl Makefile.PL

    make test
    make install
